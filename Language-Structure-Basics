This file will contain the basic's of the Laxeha-Language

----------------------------------------------------------------

When typing centances(on paper) do not use tradition spaces such as used in this file, instead use the "-" line symbol to make it easier to read.
When speaking centances, every time you start a new word, say "jase" to know you ended the current word due to what is explained on line 8.

Words are formed in a way simillar to finnish but much diffrent still, when you want to say for example "Hell" there is no word for that so you would combine the words "Fire" and "evil" or "fuck" to create it.

There is also 2 new letters in laxeha they are a "h" with the same 2 dots on top as "ä" or "ö", it is pronounced "hych", then there is an "M" with the same round big dot as "å" on top of it, it is pronounced "mn".

Numbers are formed in a weird way, so if i wanted to say for example "745" i would say it like "700 + 40 + 5" so in the laxeha "sevanannanfiinanfyns".
